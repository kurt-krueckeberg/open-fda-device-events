- I should include also the very nice graphic that accompanies each endpoint.

- The device event searchable fields are listed [here](https://open.fda.gov/apis/device/event/searchable-fields/). Compare with the
  Device Data Dictionary's Event subcategory...which is in another .md file--but which one?

The device-searchable-fields.md is not currently included in the index.rst. Do I need to better understand the categories with the Device Endpoint?

I should also list each of the endpoints--Drug, Veterinary, etc--within the Open FDA API corresponds to the separate Data Dictionaries for these
endpoint and how each endpoint is made up of subcategories that correspond to the subcategories of their respective data dictionary.

There may be another .md file not included in the index.rst, too.
