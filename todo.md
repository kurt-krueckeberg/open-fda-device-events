The syntax page should incorporate the query parameters, whic currently is on another page.

- More Query examples are needed:
  - Add examples to syntax.md
  - Add new page of example?

Have aspects of advanced syntax been omitted? Yes, likely they have like:

- dates in bracker \[\]
- date ranges
- clarification of when to use `.exact`
- how `count` works
