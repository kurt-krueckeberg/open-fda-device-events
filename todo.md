The device-searchable-fields.md is not currently included in the index.rst because I need
to better understand the categories with the Device Endpoint.

I should also list each of the endpoints--Drug, Veterinary, etc--within the Open FDA API corresponds to the separtae Data Dictionaries for these
endpoint and how each endpoint is made up of subcategories that correspond to the subcategories of their respective data dictionary.
