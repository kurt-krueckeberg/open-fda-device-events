# Device Adverse Events Searchable Fields

Fields denoted `.exact` can be searched two ways:

1. Optionally using `AND` or `+` (meaning **OR**).
2. Appending `.exact` to the field name forces exact phrase matches to be done.

These type of searches are possible for `.exact` fields:

- `search=device.openfda.device_name:"refractive+surgery` \
  returns hits for "refractive" **OR** "device".

- `search=device.openfda.device_name.exact:"refractive+device"` \
  returns hits for the exact phrase "refractive surgery".

- `count=device.openfda.device_name` \
  counts the tokenized values of this field. Instances of FOO and BAR are counted separately.

- `count=device.openfda.device_name.exact` \
  counts the total unique strings comprising exact values of this field  (whatever that means?). FOO BAR, BAR FOO, FOO, and BAR would all be counted separately, along with other combinations that contain these terms.

:::{tip}

- To exactly match a search phrase, append `.exact` to the field name: \
  `search=device.openfda.device_name.exact:"refractive surgery`

- To count the exact values of a field: \
  `count=device.openfda.device_name.exact`
