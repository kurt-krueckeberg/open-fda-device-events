These codes are from the foiclass.txt files that I download. It has the 3-letter device codes. Those below are lasik-related but not keratomes

|Code|Device name                                                                                    |
|:---|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|OCL|Surgical Device, For Cutting, Coagulation, And/Or Ablation Of Tissue, Including Cardiac Tissue|
|HQF|Laser, Ophthalmic|
|LZS|Excimer Laser System|
|OTL|Femtosecond Laser System For Refractive Correction|

**Note:** The femtosecond laser creates the flap instead of a keratome.

The keratome devices have codes of:

|Code|Device name             |
|:---|:-----------------------|
|HMY|Keratome, Battery-Powered|
|HNO|Keratome, Ac-Powered|
|MYD|Keratome, Water Jet|
|NKY|Blade, Keratome, Reprocessed|
