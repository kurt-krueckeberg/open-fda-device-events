# JSON Dataset Downloads

This information is found on the openFDA [downloads page](https://open.fda.gov/apis/downloads/).

You can automate the download of the JSON datasets with this [JSON file](https://api.fda.gov/download.json) that lists all the downloadable JSON datasets
are hosted at <https://download.open.fda.gov/>.

The [downloads page](https://open.fda.gov/apis/downloads/) explains you must re-download all availabe data file every time
new data is added:

> To keep your downloaded data up to date, you need to **re-download the data every time it is updated**. Every time an endpoint is updated
(which happens on a regular basis), it is possible that every record has changed, due to corrections or enhancements. That means that you
cannot simply download “new” files to keep your downloaded version up to date. You need to **download all available data files** for the endpoint
of interest.
