When do you -- must you or can you -- use `:` instead of -- or as an alternative to -- `=` for searching a field(s) for a term(s)?
The doucmentation instroduces `:` but then shows lots of `field=term` examples.

- More Query examples are needed:
  - Add examples to syntax.md
  - Add new page of example?

Have aspects of advanced syntax been omitted? Yes, likely they have like:

- dates in bracker \[\]
- date ranges
- clarification of when to use `.exact`
- how `count` works
