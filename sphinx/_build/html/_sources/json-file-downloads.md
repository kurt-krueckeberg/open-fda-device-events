# JSON Dataset Downloads

This information is found on the openFDA [downloads page](https://open.fda.gov/apis/downloads/).

You can write code to automate the download of the openFDA JSON datasets. A JSON file containing links to all the downloadable JSON datasets
is available [here](https://api.fda.gov/download.json).
 
The data files are hosted at <https://download.open.fda.gov/>.

As the [downloads page](https://open.fda.gov/apis/downloads/) also explains:

> To keep your downloaded data up to date, you need to re-download the data every time it is updated. Every time an endpoint is updated
(which happens on a regular basis), it is possible that every record has changed, due to corrections or enhancements. That means that you
cannot simply download “new” files to keep your downloaded version up to date. You need to download all available data files for the endpoint
of interest.
