# JSON Dataset Downloads

As the openFDA [downloads page](https://open.fda.gov/apis/downloads/) explains:

A JSON file containing links to all the openFDA downloadable JSON datasets is [available](https://api.fda.gov/download.json) to allow you to
write code to automate the download. The data files are hosted at <https://download.open.fda.gov/>.

As the [downloads page](https://open.fda.gov/apis/downloads/) also explains:

> To keep your downloaded data up to date, you need to re-download the data every time it is updated. Every time an endpoint is updated
(which happens on a regular basis), it is possible that every record has changed, due to corrections or enhancements. That means that you
cannot simply download “new” files to keep your downloaded version up to date. You need to download all available data files for the endpoint
of interest.
