# Query Parameters

The **openFDA** API supports these five query parameters:

| Parameter type | How it is used                                                                                                              |
|:---------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`search`| What to search for and in which fields. If you donâ€™t specify a field to search, the API will search in every field.|
|`sort`| Sort the results of the search by the specified field in ascending or descending order by using the `:asc` or `:desc` modifier.|
|`count`| Count the **number of unique values** of a certain field, for all the records that matched the search parameter. By default, the 1000 most frequent values are returned.|
|`limit`| Return up to this number of records that match the search parameter. Currently, the largest allowed limit is 1000.|
|`skip`| Skip this number of records that match the search parameter, then return the matching records that follow. Use `skip` in combination with `limit` to paginate results. Currently, the largest allowed value for the skip parameter is 25000. |

:::{important}
Remember: query parameters must be separated by `&`
:::
Query paramters must be separated by `&`; for example, if the `limit` parameter is used along with the `sort` parameter to return the first ten adverse drug even records (sorted in descending order by received date)

<https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?sort=receivedate:desc&limit=10>

then the `limit` parameter must be separated from the `sort` parameter (and its sort criteria) by an `&`.

## Using Query Parameters

### the `count` parameter

`count` counts **unique values** of a certain fields; for example, in the query

`https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?count=patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt.exact`

the number of unique phrases found in `patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt.exact` is counted. The `.exact` suffix tells the API
to count whole phrases (e.g. "DRUG INEFFECTIVE") instead of individual words (e.g. "DRUG" and "INEFFECTIVE" separately).

`count` is also often used along with `search`. TODO: Add example

### `search` and `count` of `.exact` fields


## Boolean OR Searches

To search for records that match either of two search terms or two search two or more fields for combined results, use the `+` for logical OR:

Below we search for two terms in the `device.device_report_product_code` field:

<https://api.fda.gov/device/event.json?search=device.device_report_product_code="HQF"+device.device_report_product_code="LZS">

You can also search two different fields and return the union of the results of each, i.e.,  a logical OR. Below we query the
**drug/event** endpoint for a record where either fatigue was a reported patient reaction or the country in which the event happened was Canada.

<https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json?search=patient.reaction.reactionmeddrapt:"fatigue"+occurcountry:"ca"&limit=1>

## Boolean AND Searches

search=field:term+AND+field:term: Search for records that match both terms.

## Using Grouping
